# Adding a new Language

## Overview

All phonological data: graphemes, allophones, positional graphemes, ancestry,
sources: lives in standalone JSON files under `orthography2ipa/data/`, one per
language code. The engine is language-agnostic: adding a language means writing
cited data, never code. The field-by-field authoring reference is
[`SCHEMA.md`](../orthography2ipa/data/SCHEMA.md); this page is the walkthrough.

A spec must declare **`graphemes` or `phonemes`**: the spelling, the inventory, or
both. It may not be silent about both. "Every language has graphemes" is false: a
logographic script has no grapheme→IPA rule to write (`zh-Hani` ships an empty map
on purpose), and an unwritten or reconstructed language has no orthography at all,
yet both have a phonology. Say which kind of writing the graphemes are with
[`orthography_kind`](orthography_kind.md).

Two things a spec does **not** declare:

- **No `family` string.** Classification comes from the clade nodes above the
  spec in the ancestry graph: set `parent` and `family` derives itself. See
  [Classification](#classification-wire-it-into-the-clade-chain) below.
- **No engine hooks.** If a language needs behaviour the shared engine cannot
  express, that is a gap in the engine or in the spec vocabulary, not a reason
  for language-specific code.

## JSON Loader API

```python
from orthography2ipa.json_loader import (
    load_json_spec,
    load_all_json_specs,
    available_json_codes
)

# Load a single spec
spec = load_json_spec("es-ES")

# Load all specs
specs = load_all_json_specs()

# List available codes
codes = available_json_codes()  # ['de-DE', 'en-GB', 'es-ES', ...]

```

---

## Inheritance System

Many dialects share most of their phonological data with a parent variety. Instead of duplicating entire grapheme maps,
JSON files can inherit from a base spec using `*_base` fields:

```json
{
  "code": "es-ES-x-andalusia-w",
  "graphemes_base": "es-ES",
  "graphemes": {
    "c": [
      "k",
      "s",
      "θ"
    ],
    "ll": [
      "ʝ"
    ]
  },
  "allophones_base": "es-ES",
  "allophones": {
    "s": [
      "s",
      "h",
      "∅"
    ],
    "x": [
      "h"
    ]
  }
}
```

The loader resolves `es-ES` first, copies its graphemes, then overlays the four overridden entries. This replaces the
Python `{**GRAPHEMES_ES, ...}` pattern.

### Inheritance rules

1. Only explicitly listed entries override the base: everything else is inherited.
2. Inheritance chains are resolved recursively (A inherits B which inherits C).
3. Circular inheritance is detected and raises `ValueError`.
4. Each of `graphemes`, `allophones`, and `positional_graphemes` can independently inherit from different bases.

## Adding a New Language (JSON)

### Step 1: Create the JSON file

Create `orthography2ipa/data/{code}.json`:

```json
{
  "code": "xx-YY",
  "name": "Language Name",
  "script": "Latin",
  "graphemes": {
    "a": [
      "a"
    ],
    "ch": [
      "tʃ"
    ]
  },
  "allophones": {
    "a": [
      "a"
    ],
    "tʃ": [
      "tʃ"
    ]
  },
  "positional_graphemes": {
    "b": {
      "default": [
        "b"
      ],
      "intervocalic": [
        "β"
      ]
    }
  },
  "parent": "parent-code",
  "ancestors": [
    {
      "code": "parent-code",
      "role": "parent",
      "weight": 0.85,
      "notes": "Primary descent"
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Source: Author (year). Title."
}
```

### Step 2: Ensure parent exists

The parent language must have its own JSON file. If adding a dialect, ensure the standard variety is already in the
dataset. For historical languages, ensure the ancestral chain connects back to a proto-language.

### Classification: wire it into the clade chain

A family is a **clade node**: a spec whose JSON carries `"clade": true`, a
`name` (`"Ibero-Romance"`), and a `parent` pointing at the next clade up. It is
classification and nothing else: no graphemes, no allophones, never inherited
from, and excluded from `available_codes()` unless `include_clades=True`.

So a new language is classified by pointing its `parent` at the right node, and
`family` / `family_path` derive themselves:

```python
import orthography2ipa

orthography2ipa.get("pt-BR").family_path   # ('Indo-European', 'Italic', 'Romance', 'Ibero-Romance')
orthography2ipa.get("pt-BR").family        # 'Indo-European > Italic > Romance > Ibero-Romance'
```

If the clade the language belongs to has no node yet, add the node: do not
author a `family` string to route around the missing one. The one case where an
explicit `family` string is right is a grouping that is *not* a genetic clade:
creoles, constructed languages, isolates, unclassified languages.

### Metadata worth filling in

Beyond the phonology, a spec is the place to record what the language *is*:

| Field | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `sources` | The citation bar for `research` tier: every mapping traceable to a published description |
| `orthography_standard` | The official spelling norm, where one exists: the primary authority for what a grapheme *is* |
| `location` | Representative point (lat/lon); feeds `geographic_distance`: most meaningful for region-anchored dialects |
| `timespan` | Attestation period; decays ancestry weights across time |
| `glottolog_code`, `wikidata_qid`, `phoible_id`, `wals_code`, `iso639_3` | Cross-references. `wikidata_qid` is the hub: one QID resolves the rest |
| `wikipedia`, `urls` | Human-readable references |

### Looking for a source: what a phone inventory cannot tell you

A grapheme table maps a **letter** to the phones it can take. A phone inventory lists the
phones a variety **has**. These are different facts, and the second never settles the
first — a variety with both /q/ and /ɡ/ in its inventory still leaves ⟨ق⟩ undecided, which
is the reflex a spec exists to record.

This matters because the sources easiest to reach are inventories. Two worked examples,
both from real searches, so nobody repeats them:

- **PHOIBLE** is referenced by the `phoible_id` field and is the obvious place to look. It
  covers Arabic at macrolanguage and standard-variety level only: a search of the full
  database by ISO code returns **zero segments** for `ayh`, `acq`, `abv`, `ssh`, `aao`,
  `adf`, `aec`, `avl`, `ayp`, `bbz` and `sqr`. Even where it has an inventory, it gives
  phones and not letter mappings.
- A **sound-definition list** in a phonetic description has the same shape. Dawod's 1952
  thesis on the Aden dialect lists "voiced velar plosive" and "voiceless uvular plosive"
  in readable English, which establishes that Aden has both — and its one table mapping
  letters to those sounds has the symbol column faded off the scan. The inventory is
  legible and the reflexes are not recoverable.

So when a source is hard to get, ask first whether it would answer the question. What a
spec needs is a statement of the form "⟨ق⟩ is realised as X in this variety", with a page
number. An inventory, a phoneme count, a table of contents listing a section on velar
stops, or a frequency count over a corpus are all evidence that a phone or a letter
**occurs** — none of them licenses a reading.

Where no such statement can be obtained, the honest spec is a `stub` that says so and
names where the description would be found, not a `research` spec filled from the nearest
inventory.

### Step 3: For dialects, use inheritance

If the language shares most phonological data with a parent:

```json
{
  "code": "xx-YY-x-dialect",
  "graphemes_base": "xx-YY",
  "graphemes": {
    "only": [
      "overrides"
    ]
  },
  "allophones_base": "xx-YY",
  "allophones": {
    "only": [
      "overrides"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Run tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

The test suite validates:

- All JSON files parse correctly
- Every spec has its required fields (name, script, and `graphemes` **or** `phonemes`: a spec may not be silent about both)
- Every `parent` field points to an existing spec
- Every PARENT-role ancestor exists in the dataset
- Linguistic accuracy for key languages (Spanish θ, English th, German Auslautverhärtung, etc.)

## Suffix morphology (`grammatical_endings`, optional)

When an ending's realisation belongs to the *grammatical ending* rather than to
the letters that spell it — French mute ⟨-er⟩/⟨-ez⟩, English ⟨-tion⟩ → [ʃən] —
declare it in `grammatical_endings`, never as a grapheme key (morpheme chunks
are forbidden grapheme keys; see `AGENTS.md`). The ending is matched at the
word's effective end only, so word-internal letters are untouched, and
`word_exceptions` still outranks it. Full contract:
[`SCHEMA.md`](../orthography2ipa/data/SCHEMA.md#grammatical-endings).

When the ending has more than one licit reading and the spelling does not say
which — French verbal ⟨-ent⟩ is mute, nominal ⟨-ent⟩ is [ɑ̃] — do **not** pick
one and do not reach for a word list. Declare it as an ordered candidate list
(`"ent": [null, ""]`) so both readings are in the lattice and a downstream
rescorer can choose: [Ambiguous
endings](../orthography2ipa/data/SCHEMA.md#ambiguous-endings).

---

## Adding a lexicon overlay (optional)

When grapheme rules cannot reach production accuracy for a deep-orthography
language, ship a **lexicon**: a sidecar file
a caller-registered `{code}.tsv` (`word<TAB>ipa`, UTF-8, NFC, never bundled: lowercase words, sorted, first-entry-wins), named by the language's resolved
code (e.g. `en-GB.tsv`). No JSON change and no new spec field are needed: the
file is discovered by convention and read lazily on first use. See
[`data_model.md`](data_model.md#lexicon-overlay-sidecar-word_exceptions-at-scale)
for the full contract (precedence: inline `word_exceptions` > lexicon > rules).

Rules to follow when adding one:

1. **Keep the pilot small and license-clean.** The bundled `en-GB.tsv` is a
   ~5k top-frequency slice of CMUdict (BSD-style, public domain), converted to
   broad IPA by `scripts/build_en_lexicon.py`. Cite the source in
   [`bibliography.md`](bibliography.md). Full production lexica (hundreds of
   thousands of entries) belong in a downstream package, not in this library.
2. **Validate.** Every entry must pass `lexicon.validate_lexicon_text` (correct
   `word<TAB>ipa` shape, NFC, lowercase word, IPA-characters-only, no
   duplicates); the shipped-data test enforces this over every `*.tsv`.
3. **Speak the spec's IPA convention.** Convert source pronunciations to the
   same broad IPA the language's `graphemes` use, so lexicon and rule output
   are comparable.
4. **Report the impact.** Regenerate the rules-only vs with-lexicon comparison
   with `python scripts/benchmark.py --lexicon-report` so
   [`lexicon_scoreboard.md`](lexicon_scoreboard.md) shows the overlay improves
   PER without masking rule regressions.
