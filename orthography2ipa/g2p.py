"""g2p — Top-level grapheme→IPA engine.

One obvious call to transcribe text in any covered language::

    >>> import orthography2ipa
    >>> orthography2ipa.transcribe("olá mundo", "pt")
    'oˈla ˈmundo'

The :class:`G2P` engine composes the package's pieces into a
data-driven pipeline:

1. **normalize** — a caller-supplied callable (diacritization, number
   expansion); identity by default.
2. **word split** — :class:`~orthography2ipa.phonetok.PhonetokTokenizer`
   token stream grouped at whitespace/punctuation; punctuation marks
   pausal positions.
3. **per-word search** — greedy (``beam_width=1``) or beam expansion of
   IPA candidates. Beaming per word avoids the combinatorial blow-up of
   whole-sentence beams.
4. **stress** — when the spec declares
   :class:`~orthography2ipa.types.StressRules`, the stressed syllable is
   detected (per-language syllabifier plugins are honoured) and marked.
5. **sandhi** — the spec's cross-word rules via
   :class:`~orthography2ipa.sandhi.SandhiEngine`.
6. **dialect transform** — :func:`~orthography2ipa.transforms.apply_transform`
   profile, applied last.

The engine is intentionally self-contained: it never loads external
G2P implementations. Downstream engines (arbtok for Arabic, tugaphone
for Portuguese) *consume* this library — its spec data, tokenizer,
stress rules and base types — and own their richer pipelines.

        tags, ISO 639-3 aliases and nearest-match all work).
    spec : Optional[LanguageSpec]
        Run on this spec instead of the registry's. For a caller whose spec
        is a variation on a shipped one — a ``dataclasses.replace`` copy
        that teaches the stress rules one more written accent, say — this is
        the way to build the engine on it, because everything the engine
        derives from a spec (tokenizer, sandhi engine, allophone rescorer)
        is compiled during construction and reading it from an attribute
        afterwards is too late. The engine never writes to the spec, so the

        each phoneme from ``spec.allophones`` (flat ``+0.5`` cost each). This
        *inflates* the search space with every variant; it does not pick the
        contextually-correct one. Use it to see all surface possibilities.
        Independent of :paramref:`apply_allophony` (the realisation path).
    apply_allophony : bool
        Apply the spec's declarative ``allophone_rules`` — the post-lexical
        ``phoneme → surface`` realisation pass (Workstream B8) — as a
        rescorer after phoneme selection and before stress/sandhi. Default
        ``True``, but a **no-op for every spec that declares no**
        ``allophone_rules`` (i.e. all shipped specs bar the pilots), so the
        default engine path stays byte-identical. Set ``False`` to force
        broad/phonemic output even for a spec that declares rules. See
        :mod:`orthography2ipa.allophony`.
    dialect_profile : Optional[str]
        ``DIALECT_PROFILES`` key applied to the final IPA
        (see :func:`orthography2ipa.apply_transform`).
    apply_sandhi : bool
        Apply the spec's cross-word sandhi rules (default).
    apply_stress : bool
        Insert stress marks when the spec declares stress rules
        (default).
    normalizer : Optional[Callable[[str], str]]
        Pre-G2P text preparation (diacritization, number expansion);
        identity when omitted.
    on_unmapped : str
        How to react when a word contains characters absent from the

          ``logging.warning`` emitted once per distinct ``(lang, word)``
          pair.
        - ``"raise"``: raises

        Unlike :meth:`candidates`, which exposes the RAW beam paths (no
        stress marks, no geminate collapse, no grammatical-ending
        rewrite, no lexicon override), every string returned here has
        been through the same word-final pipeline as
        :meth:`transcribe_word` — geminate collapse, grammatical-ending
        rewrite, stress marking, and the lexicon/``word_exceptions``
        override.

        Element 0 is normally ``transcribe_word(word)``, but that is an
        EMPIRICAL property, not a guarantee. :meth:`transcribe_word`
        defaults to ``search="greedy"``, which prunes to a single
        hypothesis at every step; this method runs a real beam of
        ``max(k, 8)``. A wider beam may reach a cheaper path that greedy
        pruning discarded, in which case element 0 is the BETTER reading
        and differs from :meth:`transcribe_word`. Pass
        ``beam_width=1`` to force the greedy path and make the identity
        hold by construction, at the cost of getting one candidate.

        The benchmark harness relies on the identity to make oracle@k
        comparable to the 1-best PER, so it re-checks it on every run
        and aborts on a mismatch rather than trusting it.

        Duplicates are collapsed (two beam paths often finalize to the
        same string once stress and geminate collapse have run), so the
        result may be shorter than *k*. A word with a lexicon or
        ``word_exceptions`` override has exactly ONE reading — the
        override — and the list has length 1: no beam is consulted.

        *beam_width* defaults to ``max(k, 8)``; a beam narrower than *k*
        cannot produce *k* readings.

        Returns an EMPTY list for a word with no pronounceable output

        Each token is LOCATED in the syllabified word rather than counted

        character for character, and it does not: the tokenizer emits nothing
        for a character the spec has no grapheme for, so a word carrying a
        digit or a hyphen (``102-jährige``, ``1-pentanol``) desynchronised the
        two and drove every later token into the wrong syllable — which then
        read as the STRESSED one and gave *jährige* a final ɛ instead of ə.
        Searching forward from the last match cannot drift: an unmatched
        character is skipped over instead of shifting everything after it.

        A token that cannot be located at all keeps the syllable of the token
        before it, which is the nearest true answer available.
