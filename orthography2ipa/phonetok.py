"""phonetok — Language-agnostic grapheme tokenizer with IPA beam expansion.

Tokenises raw text into grapheme tokens using a language's grapheme table
(maximal-munch / longest-match), then expands those tokens into all
possible IPA transcription paths via beam search.

Design principles
─────────────────
1. **Language-agnostic algorithm**: the tokenizer knows nothing about any
   specific language.  All linguistic knowledge comes from LanguageSpec.
2. **Maximal munch**: at each position the longest matching grapheme wins.
   Ties are impossible because grapheme keys are unique strings.
3. **Special tokens**: whitespace, punctuation, digits, and unknown
   characters each get their own token type so downstream consumers
   can handle them uniformly.
4. **Beam search IPA expansion**: because a single grapheme can map to
   multiple IPA values (e.g. English ⟨c⟩ → /k/ or /s/), the full
   transcription of a word is a combinatorial product.  We provide
   beam-width-bounded enumeration of all paths, optionally with
   allophone expansion.

Usage

# Arabic-script pre-tokenization normalization
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Two script-scoped normalizations run *before* grapheme tokenization for
# Arabic-script specs. Both are opt-in by script/spec so no other script is
# ever touched (Latin, Devanagari, … are byte-identical).
#
# 1. Presentation-form / ligature decomposition. The Arabic Presentation
#    Forms-A (U+FB50–U+FDFF) and Forms-B (U+FE70–U+FEFF) blocks hold
#    contextual glyph variants and ligatures — most importantly the four
#    lam-alif ligatures ﻻ/ﻷ/ﻵ/ﻹ (U+FEFB/FEF7/FEF5/FEF9), which decompose to
#    ل + ا/أ/آ/إ. These are *glyphs*, not letters: the base grapheme table
#    keys them on the canonical letters, so a bare ﻻ would otherwise
#    tokenize to nothing and yield an empty transcription. We NFKC-decompose
#    only codepoints inside those two blocks (leaving every other codepoint,
#    and every other script, untouched — a plain global NFKC would also fold
#    Latin ligatures, full-width forms, etc.).
# 2. Gemination (shadda, ّ U+0651). A consonant carrying shadda is a
#    geminate — it surfaces as a doubled/long consonant, and this holds for
#    the glides ي/و, which geminate as the consonants they are (Ryding 2005,
#    *A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic*, "Phonology and script",
#    doubling of consonants and the approximants/semivowels waaw & yaa,
#    pp. 15–16; Watson 2002, *The Phonology and Morphology of Arabic*, on MSA
#    gemination via shadda). We model it as a text-level transform: double
#    the base consonant and drop the shadda,
#    so downstream per-slot resolution sees two ordinary consonant slots
#    (surface e.g. عَمَّ → [ʕamma], not a length mark stranded on the vowel).
#    Both Unicode orderings of the mark cluster are handled: the canonical
#    consonant+shadda+harakat and the equally-valid consonant+harakat+shadda
#    (they render identically and NFC does not reorder them, since shadda
#    ccc=33 and the harakat ccc=27–32 are distinct non-zero classes).

    :meth:`PhonetokTokenizer.ipa_lattice` returns the slots in **surface
    order**, and concatenating each slot's top (lowest-cost) candidate
    reproduces :meth:`PhonetokTokenizer.ipa_best` called with default
    arguments (the lattice has no slots for whitespace, so a non-empty
    ``word_separator`` or ``include_special=True`` is not reflected). This
    is the per-position lattice — the structured object downstream engines
    consume — not a flattened list of whole-word path strings (that is
    :class:`IPAPath` / :meth:`PhonetokTokenizer.ipa_beam`).

    Extension seams (implemented in later work, noted here so the shape is
    stable): a *rescorer* (B4) hooks in by adjusting each candidate's
    ``cost`` given the surrounding slots before a path is chosen; a
    *confidence* signal (B5) is derived from the top-1 vs top-2 ``cost``
    margin within a slot. Both read this object without changing it.

# Per-word confidence / OOV signal (B5)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# A pure, deterministic read off the lattice slots — no global state, no
# randomness, thread-safe. The signal answers one question for a downstream
# specialized phonemizer: *where should it spend its expensive lexicon/rules?*
# High confidence ⇒ trust the base engine's fallback; low confidence ⇒ the
# base engine is unsure, so the specialized engine earns its keep there.
#
# It is built entirely from costs the lattice already carries
# (``Candidate.cost`` = −log P for a weighted spec, rank cost otherwise; see
# ``docs/lattice.md``), combining three signals:
#
# 1. **Ambiguity** — the top-1 vs top-2 ``cost`` margin *within* a slot. A
#    large margin means one option dominates (confident); a margin of ``0``
#    means two options tie (maximally ambiguous). A slot with a single
#    candidate has no rival, so its margin is ``+inf`` (fully unambiguous).
#    Mapped to ``[0, 1]`` by ``1 − exp(−margin)``: ``margin=0 → 0``,
#    ``margin=+inf → 1``.
# 2. **Rarity** — the absolute cost of the *best* candidate. A slot whose
#    winner is itself high-cost (a rare mapping, large −log P) is less
#    trustworthy than one whose winner is the canonical ``cost=0`` option.
#    Mapped by ``exp(−cost1)``: ``cost1=0 → 1``, larger cost → smaller.
# 3. **Coverage / OOV** — folded in by the caller (see
#    :meth:`G2P.word_confidence`): any unmapped grapheme multiplies the
#    lattice confidence by ``coverage`` (< 1), sharply lowering it.
#
# Per slot the ambiguity and rarity factors multiply; across the word the
# **minimum** slot confidence wins ("weakest link"): a single ambiguous or
# rare position drags the whole word down, which is exactly the position a
# downstream engine should target.

    Wraps a single grapheme token and exposes what phonemizers built on
    top of this library otherwise re-roll by hand: access to neighbouring
    grapheme tokens (``prev``/``next``, arbitrary ``±N`` offsets and a
    ``neighbors`` window), the grapheme's character span, and
    phonological-class predicates that delegate to
    :mod:`orthography2ipa.vowels` (the single source of truth for vowel
    classification — no vowel set is defined here).

    Neighbours are **word-local**: they are the nearest GRAPHEME tokens
    *within the same run of graphemes*, and never cross a WHITESPACE,
    PUNCTUATION, DIGIT or UNKNOWN token. The first grapheme of a word has
    ``prev is None``; the last has ``next is None``. Offsets that fall past
    a word edge return ``None`` (from :meth:`at`) or are omitted (from
    :meth:`neighbors`).

    Class predicates delegate to :mod:`orthography2ipa.vowels` on the
    grapheme's first character. For the common single-character vowel
    graphemes this is exact; for multi-character graphemes (digraphs such
    as ``ch``/``qu``/``ai``) the leading character is used, so a
    consonant digraph reports as a consonant and a vowel digraph reports
    by its leading vowel.

    """Push the nasal-carrier requirement back onto the preceding slot.

    A slot whose ONLY reading is the bare combining tilde (a coda ⟨ں⟩ /
    ⟨m n⟩ nasalisation slot) cannot be realised unless the segment before
    it is an oral vowel or a glide — that is the guard in
    :meth:`PhonetokTokenizer._expand_beam`. The guard is a BIGRAM
    constraint, but it is only evaluated once the previous slot has
    already been chosen, so a narrow beam can commit to a non-carrier
    reading and then have no legal continuation at all. Urdu's
    hamza-on-waw plurals are exactly that shape: ⟨ؤ⟩ resolves to /ʔ/ at
    cost 0 and to /o/ at cost 1, so a width-1 (greedy) search takes /ʔ/
    and is then stuck, while a width-8 search keeps /o/ alive and returns
    the legal *aːnsəõ*. The two paths disagreed, which is precisely the
    ``word_candidates()[0] != transcribe_word()`` divergence.

    Resolving the constraint HERE — before any pruning — makes it
    search-width independent: each candidate predecessor slot simply loses
    the readings that cannot carry the tilde, provided it keeps at least
    one that can. An empty (deleted) reading is always kept: it
    contributes no segment, so the carrier can be supplied by a slot
    further left — and because a deletable slot means the ACTUAL carrier
    might land on whichever slot precedes it, the filter walks back past
    every such deletable slot (not just the immediate predecessor) until
    it reaches one that cannot delete itself. A slot with an oral
    fallback beside the tilde is left alone — there the runtime guard
    (:meth:`PhonetokTokenizer._expand_beam`) has a legal alternative and
    no backwards pressure is needed.

    A shape that is NOT covered by construction: a chain where the
    deletable slot sits behind another non-deletable, non-carrier slot
    that has no oral fallback of its own (e.g. two stacked silent
    letters between the vowel and the tilde, where the outer one cannot
    itself resolve to an oral vowel). No language spec shipped with this
    package has that shape — verified by an exhaustive search over every
    deletable-grapheme pair in every tilde-bearing language's inventory,
    not just spot-checked — so it is left undocumented as a test case
    rather than carrying a speculative ``xfail``; add one if such a
    shape is ever added to a spec.

    Emitted IPA normal form: nasalisation marks the base VOWEL, with any
    length mark following it (``ũː``), never the reverse (``uː̃``, tilde
    trailing the length mark) — see :func:`_splice_nasal_tilde`, which
    performs the actual insertion once :meth:`PhonetokTokenizer.
    _expand_beam` accepts a tilde branch; this function only decides
    which branches survive, not how the accepted tilde is written.

        Parameters
        ----------
        text : str
            Input text to transcribe.
        beam_width : int
            Maximum number of concurrent hypotheses (paths) to maintain.
            Set to -1 or a very large number for exhaustive enumeration.
        expand_allophones : bool
            If True, expand each phoneme into its allophonic variants
            from ``spec.allophones``, multiplying the search space.
        word_separator : str
            String to insert between words in the IPA output.  Set to
            ``""`` for no separator.
        include_special : bool
            If True, include whitespace/punct/digit tokens in the IPA
            path as literal strings instead of ignoring them.
        length_norm : bool
            Opt-in scoring quality knob (default ``False`` preserves the
            exact current ordering). When ``True`` each returned path's
            :attr:`IPAPath.score` is the **mean per-segment cost**
            (cumulative cost ÷ number of segments) instead of the raw
            cumulative cost, and paths are ranked by it. Beam *pruning* is
            unchanged (still by raw cumulative cost), so a single word's
            hypotheses — which all share the same segment count — keep
            their relative order; the normalisation only makes scores
            comparable across inputs of different length.
        diversity : float
            Opt-in diversity penalty (default ``0.0`` = off, preserving the
            exact current ordering). When ``> 0`` the returned paths are
            re-ranked with a Maximal-Marginal-Relevance pass: the top path
            is kept, and each subsequent path is penalised by
            ``diversity × (fraction of segments it shares with the nearest
            already-selected path)``. This demotes near-duplicates of the
            top path (which otherwise dominate a long word's beam, differing
            in only one grapheme) in favour of genuinely different
            pronunciations. The top-1 path never changes.
        rescorer : LatticeRescorer | Iterable[LatticeRescorer] | None
            Optional lattice rescorer(s) (Workstream B4). When given, each
            grapheme slot's resolved candidates are re-costed by the
            rescorer(s), *in order*, **before** beam path selection — the
            downstream-enablement seam by which a rule cascade (sun-letter
            assimilation, silent-``e``) refines the shared lattice instead
            of forking a tokenizer. ``None`` (default) is byte-identical to
            no rescoring. A rescorer that returns no candidates for a slot
            deletes it (the grapheme contributes no segment). See
            :mod:`orthography2ipa.rescorer`. Stress-conditioned context is

        expand_allophones : bool
            Enumerate surface allophone variants (from ``spec.allophones``)
            as extra candidates, mirroring :meth:`ipa_beam`.
        rescorer : LatticeRescorer | Iterable[LatticeRescorer] | None
            Optional lattice rescorer(s) (Workstream B4). When given, each
            slot's candidates are re-costed by the rescorer(s), in order,
            *before truncation*, so the returned lattice reflects the
            rescored costs. A rescorer that returns no candidates for a slot
            deletes it (the slot is omitted from the returned list).
            ``None`` (default) leaves the lattice byte-identical. See
