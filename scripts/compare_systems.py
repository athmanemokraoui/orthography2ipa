"""Compare orthography2ipa against other G2P systems on the same gold rows.

Runs the SAME gold word/IPA pairs used by ``scripts/benchmark.py`` through
several systems — orthography2ipa, espeak-ng, epitran, gruut, pycotovia,
ahotts-g2p, africa-g2p, and the o2i-downstream family (arbtok, tugaphone,
g2p_barranquenho, mwl_phonemizer, udarnik) — and scores every system with the exact
same normalization
and PER metric (``benchmark.normalize`` / ``benchmark.levenshtein``), so
the numbers are directly comparable to the committed scoreboard.

Systems are optional. If a system's tool/library is unavailable, or a
language has no explicit voice/code mapping for it, that system's column
is reported as ``n/a`` for that row — the script never crashes because a
comparison target is missing.

- **espeak-ng**: shelled out via ``espeak-ng -q --ipa -v <voice> <word>``,
  one process per word (small gold slices; simplicity over throughput).
  Detected with ``shutil.which("espeak-ng")``. Catalan dialect voices
  (``ca``, ``ca-ba``, ``ca-nw``, ``ca-va`` — BSC's central/balear/
  north-western/valencian voices) are discovered at runtime via
  ``espeak-ng --voices=ca`` rather than hardcoded, so a missing voice
  degrades to an honest ``n/a``/generic-voice fallback instead of a
  fabricated dialect number; see ``discover_catalan_dialect_voices``.
- **epitran**: optional Python library (``pip install .[compare]``),
  imported lazily. Needs an ISO 639-3 + ISO 15924 script code per
  language (e.g. ``spa-Latn``).
- **gruut**: optional Python library (``pip install .[compare]``),
  imported lazily. Needs a gruut language code (e.g. ``es``).
- **pycotovia**: optional Python library (``pip install .[compare]``),
  a pure-Python port of Cotovia (Univ. de Vigo / GTM) covering Galician
  and Spanish. Imported lazily; ``pycotovia.phonemize`` output is passed
  through ``pycotovia.cotovia_to_ipa`` to get comparable IPA.
- **ahotts-g2p**: optional Python library (``pip install .[compare]``,
  imported as ``ahotts_g2p``), the pure-Python G2P port of AhoTTS
  (Aholab / HiTZ, Univ. of the Basque Country) covering Basque (``eu``)
  and Spanish (``es``). ``ahotts_g2p.phonemize`` emits its output in the
  StyleTTS2 single-character training convention, where the library's
  ``MULTI`` table folds a handful of IPA sequences onto single ASCII
  letters — affricates (``tʃ``→``C``, ``ts``→``V``, ``tʂ``→``P``),
  aspirates (``pʰ``→``H``, ``kʰ``→``K``, ``tʰ``→``T``), and **stress-
  marked vowels** (``ˈi``→``I`` … ``ˈu``→``U``). Scoring that folded form
  raw against IPA gold would charge ahotts-g2p a spurious error on every
  uppercase char, so ``ahotts_transcribe`` first UNFOLDS it back to
  standard IPA (the inverse of ``ahotts_g2p.phones.MULTI``, stress
  rendered as ``ˈ`` so the shared ``normalize`` strips it exactly as it
  does for every other system) BEFORE the shared normalize()/PER — all
  systems are therefore compared in one IPA space.

  (The separate ``pyahotts`` package is the *audio* port of AhoTTS: its
  only public API synthesizes WAV bytes and exposes no phoneme output, so
  it is not scorable and is intentionally NOT a comparison system here —
  ``ahotts-g2p`` is the text-level G2P port that supersedes it for this
  table.)
- **africa-g2p**: optional Python library covering ~400 African-language
  ISO 639-3 codes (AfriSpeech, rule-based G2P derived from Omniglot script charts and Hartell's
  *Alphabets of Africa*, UNESCO 1993). Published on PyPI as ``africa-g2p``
  (0.2.4 when the ``ee`` row was added) but not part of the ``[compare]``
  extra; install it into the run environment before running this script::

      uv pip install --prerelease=allow africa-g2p

  Imported lazily as ``africa_g2p``; a missing install degrades every
  ``africa_g2p`` column to ``n/a``, same as every other optional system.
  Wrapped via ``AfricaPipeline(lang=<iso639_3>, output="ipa").run(word)``;
  the library's own ``africa_g2p.loader.registry()`` is queried at import
  time so the set of covered codes is never hand-enumerated here.
- **ghana-g2p**: optional Python library (GhanaNLP, PyPI ``ghana-g2p``,
  Apache-2.0) for 42 Ghanaian languages. It wraps africa-g2p's rule
  tables and adds Unicode normalisation, a patch table of corrected or
  missing letters, and donor rule sets for languages africa-g2p lacks.
  Not part of the ``[compare]`` extra. Imported lazily as ``ghana_g2p``;
  a missing install degrades every ``ghana_g2p`` column to ``n/a``.
  Wrapped via ``GhanaG2P(<iso639_3>).ipa(word, sep="")``. Its codes are
  ISO 639-3, so a ``LANGS`` entry keyed by an ISO 639-1 tag names the code
  explicitly (``ee`` -> ``ewe``).
- **udarnik**: optional Python library covering Russian (``ru``), the
  o2i-downstream engine that supplies the lexical stress the ``ru`` spec
  says it cannot find. Needs ``stressonnx`` and its Russian accentuation
  model, which downloads into the standard Hugging Face cache on first
  use; call the column's plugin once before a timed run if that matters.
  Not part of the ``[compare]`` extra while it is unpublished — install
  it from a checkout the same way ``africa-g2p`` is installed above.
  Imported lazily; a missing install degrades the ``udarnik`` column to
  ``n/a``, and so does a missing stress model — but only because the
  column builds its OWN stressonnx injector with ``fallback=False``.
  udarnik's ``strict_stress=True`` does NOT suffice on its own: the
  injector it would build leaves ``fallback=True``, and stressonnx then
  swaps in the next backend of the ``ru`` chain instead of raising, so
  strict never fires and a substitute accentuator's output would be
  published under udarnik's name. See ``udarnik_transcribe``.
- **o2i-downstream family** (arbtok, tugaphone, g2p_barranquenho,
  mwl_phonemizer, udarnik): TigreGotico repos built directly on this repo's own
  ``orthography2ipa.G2P`` lattice, imported lazily and scored under the
  SAME lazy-import + n/a-degrade discipline as every optional system
  above. Because they share o2i's lattice, they ALSO share o2i's
  same-source exposure on gold drafted from the same knowledge that
  informed o2i's own rules (see ``_O2I_SAME_SOURCE_DATASETS`` and the
  module note by ``arbtok_transcribe`` for the full per-engine lexicon
  audit — arbtok's tiny closed-class ``WORD_EXCEPTIONS``, tugaphone's
  always-on ``tugalex`` lexicon excluded from ranking like stock
  ``espeak``, g2p_barranquenho and mwl_phonemizer both lexicon-free by
  default, udarnik with no word->IPA lexicon but a disclosed accent/
  omograph dictionary inside its stressonnx backend). They are wired in anyway because a family member can still
  be a real comparison point against a gold that is genuinely
  independent of o2i (e.g. mwl_phonemizer vs. the native-speaker
  ``mirandese_g2p`` gold, or arbtok vs. the diacritized-WikiPron ``ar``
  gold below) — and because "n/a" on a row that HAS a downstream engine
  is itself information the owner asked not to drop.

Normalization (identical across every system above, see ``benchmark.normalize``
and the stress/diacritic handling in ``espeak_agreement.py``):

1. NFC-normalize.
2. Strip stress marks (``benchmark._STRESS_MARKS`` == ``ˈˌ``): primary and
   secondary stress are never scored — no system agrees on where to place
   them consistently enough for that to be a fair signal. (The length
   mark ``ː`` is NOT in that set and is retained, exactly as
   ``benchmark.normalize`` treats it.)
3. Strip narrow-transcription diacritics (``benchmark._NARROW_MARKS``) via
   NFD decomposition — this is the same "broad" comparison mode
   ``benchmark.py --scoreboard`` uses by default.
4. Drop whitespace — segmentation-free comparison, since some systems
   space-separate phonemes and others don't.

PER is computed with ``benchmark.levenshtein(hyp, gold) / len(gold)``,
taking the best score against any gold variant for a word — exactly the
metric ``benchmark.evaluate`` uses for orthography2ipa.

Fair-comparison 2x2 (dictionary vs. rules)
-------------------------------------------

The main table above conflates two very different things espeak-ng ships
for a language: **letter-to-sound rules** (``dictsource/<lang>_rules``,
genuinely comparable to o2i's grapheme rules) and **hand-curated word-
exception lists** (``dictsource/<lang>_list``/``_listx``/``_extra`` —
a per-word lexicon espeak-ng ships and o2i, by hard rule, never bundles).
Scoring plain ``espeak`` against plain ``o2i`` therefore compares
"rules + dictionary" against "rules only" — not a fair fight. Two extra
optional columns isolate the dictionary's contribution:

- **``espeak_rules``**: espeak-ng run against a *rules-only* dictionary
  build — the exact same ``dictsource/<lang>_rules`` compiled, but with
  the ``_list``/``_listx``/``_extra`` word-exception files emptied before
  compiling. Inspecting the stripped list files (en, fr, de, nl, ca, sv,
  eu) showed they carry more than proper-noun/loanword exceptions: basic
  function words and numbers are hand-pronounced there too (English
  ``the``, ``of``, ``an``, ``and``, ``one``, ``two``; French ``le``,
  ``la``, ``les``, ``un``, ``une``, ``et``; German ``der``, ``die``,
  ``das``, ``und``, ``ein(e)``, ``zu``; Dutch ``de``, ``het``, ``een``,
  ``en``; Swedish ``en``, ``ett``, ``den``, ``det``, ``och``; Catalan
  ``el``, ``la``, ``els``, ``les``, ``de``, ``i``; Basque ``eta``) — so
  "rules-only" here means genuinely rules-only: those entries are
  stripped too, not just the proper-noun exceptions, and this column
  will visibly score WORSE than plain ``espeak`` on exactly those words.
  Build the stripped dictionaries with
  ``scripts/build_espeak_rules_only.sh`` (clones+builds espeak-ng from
  source into a scratch dir — GPL, never committed — and writes the
  compiled ``*_dict`` files to an output dir), then point this script at
  them::

      scripts/build_espeak_rules_only.sh en fr de nl ca sv eu
      ESPEAK_RULES_DATA_PATH=/path/to/rules-only-data \\
          PYTHONPATH=$PWD python scripts/compare_systems.py --scoreboard

  Without ``$ESPEAK_RULES_DATA_PATH`` set, ``espeak_rules`` is reported
  as ``n/a`` for every row, same as any other unavailable system.

- **``o2i_lex``**: orthography2ipa scored WITH a runtime lexicon built
  from espeak-ng's OWN word-exception list for that language — i.e. o2i
  gets the same per-word dictionary espeak-ng has, added via o2i's
  existing (unbundled) lexicon overlay capability
  (:mod:`orthography2ipa.lexicon`, ``register_lexicon``). The word list
  is extracted from ``dictsource/<lang>_list``/``_listx``/``_extra``
  (the words only — NOT the phoneme column, which is espeak-ng's
  internal ASCII notation, not IPA); each word's IPA is then obtained by
  actually running normal (non-stripped) ``espeak-ng --ipa -q`` on it,
  batched and cached to ``.o2i_lex_cache/<lang>.tsv`` (gitignored, never
  committed — GPL data lives only in that local cache, exactly like
  espeak-ng itself never ships in this repo). Set
  ``ESPEAK_DICTSOURCE_PATH`` to an espeak-ng checkout (or its
  ``dictsource/`` dir directly) to enable it::

      ESPEAK_DICTSOURCE_PATH=/path/to/espeak-ng \\
          PYTHONPATH=$PWD python scripts/compare_systems.py --scoreboard

  Without ``$ESPEAK_DICTSOURCE_PATH`` set, ``o2i_lex`` is ``n/a`` for
  every row.

Read together, the four columns ``o2i`` / ``o2i_lex`` / ``espeak`` /
``espeak_rules`` isolate what each system's RULES contribute versus what
its DICTIONARY contributes, on the same gold words.

Usage::

    python scripts/compare_systems.py --scoreboard
    python scripts/compare_systems.py --lang es --limit 50
    python scripts/compare_systems.py --list

Where things live
-----------------

The module reads top to bottom as config -> engines -> policy -> rendering.
Each section below carries a ``# ─── name ───`` header:

``fair-comparison 2x2`` / ``language mapping``
    Environment knobs, and ``LANGS`` — the one table mapping an o2i language
    tag to its gold dataset and to each system's per-language code. Adding a
    language is an edit here and nowhere else.
``espeak-ng`` … ``gruut``
    One section per comparison engine: a ``<name>_transcribe(word, cfg)``
    function that returns IPA or ``None``, plus whatever instance cache and
    availability check that engine needs. Every one degrades to ``None``
    rather than raising, so a missing library is an ``n/a`` cell.
``o2i_lex``
    Builds the runtime lexicon for the ``o2i_lex`` column from espeak-ng's
    own wordlist.
``lexicon-backed tier``
    ``LEXICON_TIER_ENGINES`` and the per-engine lexicon KEY extractors: the
    second, separately-ranked tier where every engine keeps its lexicon on
    and the gold is filtered against the union of all of them.
``scoring``
    ``_score`` — the shared PER metric, identical for every system.
``same-source policy``
    Which systems must be REFUSED a number on which datasets, and why.
``running the comparison``
    ``PER_WORD_ENGINES`` (the engine registry), the per-language/per-dataset
    passes, and ``_build_row`` — which defines the committed
    ``benchmarks/comparison.json`` schema.
``board persistence``
    Build the full board, merge a partial rerun into the committed one,
    read it back.
``rendering`` / ``ranking policy``
    Everything that turns rows into ``docs/comparison.md``, and the rules
    for what may be called a winner (lexicon-free only).

# point against o2i-lineage gold — see the ``_O2I_SAME_SOURCE_DATASETS``

# because a family member can still legitimately be compared against a
# GENUINELY independent gold (e.g. mwl_phonemizer vs. the native-speaker
# ``mirandese_g2p`` set) or against each other, and because "n/a" on a row
# that has a downstream engine is itself information.
#
# Per-engine lexicon disposition (the espeak discipline, audited per package
# rather than assumed):
#
# - **arbtok** — audit correction: arbtok's DEFAULT configuration is NOT
#   lexicon-free. ``ArbtokG2PPlugin.__init__`` defaults to
#   ``lexicon=DEFAULT_LEXICON`` (``hf://TigreGotico/arabic-stem-lexicon``,
#   145,890 entries) AND ``dialect_lexicon=True`` (a per-lect closed-class
#   function-word lexicon) both ON. The RANKED ``arbtok`` column
#   therefore constructs the plugin explicitly with both disabled
#   (``lexicon=None, dialect_lexicon=False`` — see
#   ``arbtok_transcribe``), leaving only the rule path plus
#   ``arbtok.dialects.WORD_EXCEPTIONS`` — a 22-entry closed set of

#   reported separately and purely informationally as ``arbtok_stock``
#   (board column "arbtok (lexicon)") — never ranked, exactly like stock
#   ``espeak``/``gruut``/``tugaphone``.
# - **tugaphone** — ``TugaPhonemizer`` always registers the curated
#   ``tugalex`` lexicon for the target lect before phonemizing
#   (``lattice_core._ensure_lexicon``, called unconditionally from
#   ``phonemize_sentence``); there is no public toggle to disable it. Same
#   disposition as stock ``espeak``: reported "(lexicon)", left on the board
#   for information, excluded from the lexicon-free Winner/leaderboard
#   ranking (see ``_LEXICON_EXCLUDED_FROM_RANKING`` below) rather than
#   silently ranked with an undisclosed lexicon on.
# - **g2p_barranquenho** — no bundled per-word lexicon; ``transcribe()`` is
#   pure lattice + rule stages. Lexicon-free, scored as-is.
# - **mwl_phonemizer** — ``MirandesePhonemizer`` carries an optional
#   native-speaker lexicon overlay and CRF corrector, both OFF by default
#   (``use_crf=False``) and the overlay only consulted when
#   ``phonemize(..., lookup=True)``. The module-level ``phonemize()``
#   convenience function used here calls neither, so scoring is pure lattice
#   output — lexicon-free by construction, no extra flag needed.

    Lexicon disposition: ranked, and effectively lexicon-free with a
    DISCLOSED exception. ``UdarnikG2PPlugin`` defaults to ``lexicon=None``,
    so there is no word->IPA layer to turn off the way
    ``arbtok_transcribe`` turns arbtok's two off. What udarnik adds over
    bare o2i is a stressonnx accentuator: a PREPROCESSING model that
    restores orthography Russian does not write (the position of the free
    lexical stress), not a lookup that answers the transcription. That is
    the disposition the board already gives arbtok's ONNX diacritizer.

    The exception, measured rather than assumed: the default ``ruaccent``
    backend is not purely neural. It consults an accent dictionary
    (110,826 entries) and an omograph dictionary (19,740) BEFORE its
    models, so a word present there gets a looked-up stress. Against the
    ``alphacep_ru_book`` gold that is 11.21% of unique words in the accent
    dictionary and 4.89% in the omograph dictionary (13.94% in either).
    Those are the SHIPPED dictionary sizes; ruaccent additionally patches
    in three hardcoded entries at load time (``о``/``О`` and ``коса``),
    which is why a live ``len()`` reads 110,828 and 19,741.
    Those dictionaries carry STRESS POSITIONS, not pronunciations — the
    phonology below the mark is entirely o2i's — so this is the same
    "effectively lexicon-free, exception documented" treatment the board
    gives ahotts-g2p, not the lexicon tier. A reviewer who disagrees
    should move the column, not delete the note.

    Strictness is enforced HERE rather than by asking udarnik for it,
    because ``strict_stress=True`` alone does NOT guarantee it.
    ``StressonnxInjector`` leaves ``fallback=True``, and stressonnx's
    ``_execute`` catches ``ModelDownloadError``/``ModelLoadError`` and
    walks the ``ru`` chain (``ruaccent`` -> ``silero`` -> ``simple``, all
    of which cover Russian) without ever raising — so ``strict`` sees no
    exception and a missing ``ruaccent`` would publish a DIFFERENT
    accentuator's output under udarnik's name. Building the injector here
    with ``fallback=False`` is what makes the failure reach ``strict`` and
    the column read ``n/a``. The backend is deliberately left unpinned
    (``prefer="best"``): the point is that the chain cannot be crossed
    SILENTLY, not that one backend is hardcoded into the board.

# ─── lexicon-backed tier: each engine's ACTUAL lookup keys ──────────────────
#
# WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS: the primary leaderboard ranks a LEXICON-FREE
# world (see "ranking policy" below) — a system's bundled per-word
# dictionary never counts toward a win, because o2i by hard rule ships
# none. That answers "whose rules are better". It does NOT answer the
# other half of the owner's question: with every engine in its STOCK
# configuration, lexicons ON, who is better?
#
# Scored naively, that second question is worthless: every gold word that
# happens to sit in an engine's lexicon is a lookup, not a prediction, and
# the winner is simply whoever shipped the bigger dictionary overlapping
# this particular gold. So the tier FILTERS the gold first — every entry
# present in ANY compared engine's lexicon for that language is removed —
# and ranks the stock engines on what is left. That residual measures
# generalization BEYOND the lexicons, which is the only thing a
# lexicon-backed comparison can honestly measure.
#
# The load-bearing part is extraction: each engine's key set must be its
# REAL lookup keys, and each gold word must be matched against them with
# the SAME normalization that engine applies at lookup time. An
# over-narrow match (e.g. comparing a raw gold word against lowercased
# keys) silently readmits lookup words into the "residual" and quietly
# turns the tier back into a dictionary-size contest. Each extractor
# below therefore states its normalization and where the keys came from,
# and every extraction is cached WITH its provenance.

#: Where extracted lexicon key sets are cached, one JSON per
#: (engine, language, source fingerprint). Under ``.benchmark_cache``
#: (gitignored) because some of these key sets are derived from data this
#: repo must never carry: espeak-ng's GPL dictsource wordlists, and
#: arbtok's corpus-mined HF stem lexicon.

                                     "lexicon_keys")

#: Below this many residual gold words, a tier row is reported as
#: "insufficient residual gold" instead of ranked: a PER over a couple of
#: dozen words is noise, and naming a winner on it would be exactly the
#: misleading precision ``_NO_SYSTEM_USABLE_THRESHOLD`` exists to refuse

#
# WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS: several registered golds were themselves produced
# by one of the systems on this board (or by o2i, or by a downstream built on
# o2i). Scoring a system against its own output is tautological — it scores
# near 0 by construction, not because it is accurate. Every rule below
# decides, per (dataset, language), which system must be REFUSED a number on
# that row. The cell then renders as "same-source" rather than "n/a", because
# "system unavailable" and "this number would be a lie" are different facts
# and the reader is entitled to know which one applies.

#: Datasets whose gold IS a competitor system's own output — scoring that
#: system against its own generator's output is tautological (it scores
#: ~0 by construction, not because it is accurate). Rather than silently
#: reporting ``n/a`` (which reads as "system unavailable"), these cells are
#: flagged ``same_source`` and rendered as ``same-source`` in the docs — a
#: different, honest reason for having no comparable number.
#:
#: - espeak/espeak_rules are excluded wherever ``benchmark.provenance_for``
#:   tags the dataset+language ``espeak-derived``.
#: - epitran is excluded wherever the tier is ``epitran-derived``.
#: - ahotts-g2p is excluded on ``hitz_basque_ipa`` specifically: that gold
#:   is HiTZ/Aholab's own ahoNT automatic phonemizer output — the same lab
#:   that authors AhoTTS (see the module docstring's ahotts-g2p section).

#: gruut's bundled ``en-US`` lexicon (``gruut_lang_en/lexicon.db``,

#: ``cmudict`` and ``ipadict``'s gold words by direct measurement (see the
#: coverage numbers this module can recompute against the installed
#: lexicon.db). For those two rows gruut is not doing G2P — it is a
#: lookup into a lexicon built from the SAME source the gold is drawn
#: from, so its low PER there measures lexicon agreement, not phonemizer
#: accuracy. gruut's independent ``en``/``en-GB`` ``wikipron`` rows are
#: NOT in this set (~44%/~43% lexicon coverage by the same measurement —

#: ``llm-generated`` tier as a whole — Claude drafted every dataset in
#: that tier, ``mirandese_dict`` and ``barranquenho_dict`` included, so
#: "which LLM" does not distinguish them. What distinguishes them is
#: whether o2i's OWN output fed back into the gold:
#: ``load_mirandese_dict``'s docstring documents that it was "NOT produced

#: consumer — so scoring o2i against it is not circular", so it stays
#: OUT of this set. ``barranquenho_dict`` is the opposite case:

#: scores against it "suggests their IPA column is itself o2i-aligned —
#: treat every number from this dataset as agreement, not correctness".

class PerWordEngine(NamedTuple):
    """One optional comparison engine that is called ONE WORD AT A TIME.

    This registry exists so adding or auditing a comparison engine is a
    ONE-LINE change in one place. Before it, every engine was spelled out
    five separate times inside ``_compare_lang_dataset`` (a result list, an
    availability gate, a per-word call, a scoring line, and a set of row
    keys); forgetting one of the five silently produced a missing or
    mis-gated column rather than an error.

    Deliberately NOT in this registry, because each is genuinely special
    rather than merely repetitive — folding them in would hide the very
    policy that makes them special:

    - ``o2i`` and ``o2i_lex`` — the system under test, not a comparison
      target; driven by an in-process ``G2P`` instance with sentence-vs-word
      dispatch, and ``o2i_lex`` needs a lexicon registered around its pass.
    - ``espeak`` and ``espeak_rules`` — batched through one subprocess per
      chunk (see :func:`espeak_batch_transcribe`), so their results are
      precomputed for all words at once rather than word by word.

    Fields:

    ``key``
        Row-key prefix (``<key>_per`` / ``<key>_n`` / ``<key>_same_source``)
        and the column key in ``_SYSTEMS``.
    ``cfg_key``
        Which ``LANGS`` entry key holds this engine's per-language config.
        ``None`` in that entry means "no mapping for this language" => the
        column is ``n/a``. Note ``arbtok_stock`` shares ``arbtok``'s
        mapping: it is the same language, just the default-configured
        (lexicon-backed) plugin.
    ``transcribe_name``
        The module-level function name to call as ``fn(word, cfg_value)``.
        Resolved BY NAME at call time, not captured as a function object,
        so ``monkeypatch.setattr(compare_systems, "gruut_transcribe", ...)``
        still takes effect — capturing the object here would silently
        bypass every test double and every future patch.
    ``same_source_key``
        Key into :func:`_same_source_flags` that suppresses this engine when
        the gold IS its own output. ``None`` means the engine can never be
        same-source, which is a POLICY claim, not an omission — see the
        per-engine reasons at each registry entry below.
    ``available_name``
        Name of an extra runtime availability predicate called as
        ``fn(cfg_value)``, beyond "the language has a mapping at all".
        Resolved by name at call time for the same reason
        ``transcribe_name`` is.
    ``deferred``
        Run in a SEPARATE pass after the o2i pass has finished, instead of
        interleaved into it. Only ``tugaphone`` needs this, and the reason
        is a real measured contamination bug — see :func:`_run_deferred`.

# the Winner column and the leaderboard rank over a LEXICON-FREE view of each
# row, while lexicon-backed columns stay visible for information. The three
# mechanisms, in the order a reader meets them:
#
#   _RULES_ONLY_SUBSTITUTES        a lexicon-backed system is ranked via its
#                                  rules-only twin (espeak -> espeak_rules),
#                                  never via its stock number.
#   _LEXICON_EXCLUDED_FROM_RANKING a lexicon-backed system with NO rules-only
#                                  twin is dropped from ranking outright.
#   _LEXICON_BACKED_INFORMATIONAL_COLUMNS
#                                  whichever excluded column would have won
#                                  is still named in an aside, so nothing is
#                                  silently buried.
#
# Ties, and the "no system is usable" escape hatch, live here too.

    - ``pycotovia`` — audited: its lexicon is closed to a small, fixed,
      rule-grade function-word stress table, not a general word
      dictionary.
    - ``ahotts`` — audited: its HDIC dictionary hits only 1.5% of the
      `eu` wikipron gold and 2.6% of `hitz_basque_ipa`, so it is
      effectively lexicon-free for ranking purposes; this is an explicit
      documented exception, not an oversight.
    - ``africa_g2p`` — rule-based G2P, no bundled per-word dictionary.
    - ``ghana_g2p`` — africa-g2p's rules plus a per-letter patch table and
      donor rule sets; no per-word dictionary.
    - ``udarnik`` — audited: no word->IPA lexicon (``lexicon=None`` by
      default), but its stressonnx ``ruaccent`` backend consults a
      110,826-entry accent dictionary and a 19,740-entry omograph
      dictionary before its models, covering 11.21% and 4.89% of unique

      pronunciation — the phonology below the mark is o2i's own, so they
      cannot answer a transcription the way a pronunciation lexicon
      does. Recorded honestly: this coverage is several times ahotts'
      1.5%/2.6%, so it is the weakest "effectively lexicon-free" claim
      on the board and the most likely to be overturned. If a reviewer
      judges a stress dictionary to be lexical knowledge for ranking
