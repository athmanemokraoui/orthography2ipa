"""Attribute the Brazilian Portuguese ``vox_communis`` PER to the gold.

The ``pt-BR`` / ``vox_communis`` row is the worst Portuguese row on the board
(PER 0.3872 over 33,958 words), which invites reading it as a defect in the
Brazilian spec. It is not one. The row's phone tier is Epitran output over the
region-untagged Common Voice ``pt`` locale, and it is European Portuguese:
measured over the cached TSV, NONE of the four features that define Brazilian
Portuguese appear in it, while the European coda sibilant appears in all of
them.

This script re-scores the row with the harness's own ``normalize()`` and
``levenshtein()``, then folds one gold convention at a time out of BOTH sides
and re-scores, so each convention gets a number instead of an adjective. It
also counts the two ways the gold is not merely a different notation but wrong
about Portuguese of any variety: it has no palatal lateral and no palatal
nasal, so every ``lh`` and ``nh`` word loses its digraph, and it writes the
``ss`` digraph as two segments with the first one palatalised.

Run it from the repository root::

    PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/fold_pt_br_notation.py

Nothing here feeds the board. The row stays as scored — it is classified
``epitran-derived`` and cannot gate anything — and this script is how the
offset is quantified. See docs/languages/pt-BR.md.
