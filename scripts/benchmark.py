"""Benchmark the orthography2ipa G2P engine against gold pronunciation sets.

Self-contained evaluation harness for this library: it loads a gold
dataset, transcribes every word with :class:`orthography2ipa.G2P`, and
reports PER (phoneme error rate) and WER (word error rate). The
datasets, their sources and the methodology are documented in
``docs/benchmarks.md``.

Usage::

    python scripts/benchmark.py --dataset portuguese_unified --lang pt-PT
    python scripts/benchmark.py --dataset wikipron --lang gl --broad
    python scripts/benchmark.py --dataset mirandese_g2p --lang mwl
    python scripts/benchmark.py --list

Dataset access:

- ``cmudict`` needs the ``scriptconv`` package for ARPABET→IPA.
- ``wikipron`` and ``mirandese_g2p`` download TSVs directly (stdlib only).
- ``portuguese_unified`` downloads a JSONL gold file directly and samples it with
  a fixed seed (stdlib only).
  (It merges the former separate infopedia / wiktionary / Portal-lexicon
  golds; one region is scored per registered language tag.)
- ``hitz_basque_ipa`` pages the HiTZ/wikipedia_basque_ipa Hugging Face
  dataset through the datasets-server "rows" REST API (stdlib only,
  no full-parquet download).
- ``clup_dialect`` downloads a CSV gold file directly (stdlib only).
  (stdlib only).
- ``ipa_childes`` downloads per-language CSVs from the
  fdemelo/ipa-childes-split Hugging Face dataset directly (stdlib only).
- ``ipa_babylm`` downloads the dev-split CSVs of the
  phonemetransformers/IPA-BabyLM Hugging Face dataset directly (stdlib only).
- ``northeuralex`` and ``wold`` download ``cldf/forms.csv`` directly from the
  lexibank/northeuralex and lexibank/wold GitHub repositories (stdlib only).
- ``kaikki`` downloads per-language Wiktextract JSON-lines dumps directly
  from kaikki.org (stdlib only).

The scoreboard also reports **oracle PER@k** — the per-word minimum PER
over the engine's top-k readings — which splits ranking error (right
answer in the beam, ranked wrong) from model error (right answer absent
at any k). It is a lattice-quality diagnostic for THIS engine only and
is never valid input to a cross-system comparison: see
:class:`OracleResult` and ``docs/benchmark_methodology.md``.

The committed ``--scoreboard`` scores the FULL gold set of every language
with NO cap (uniformly — no per-language limit juggling); the published
docs/scoreboard.md is full-dataset. ``--limit N`` still applies a uniform
cap for ad-hoc fast runs, and the CI regression gate re-scores at a fixed
uniform sample (see ``--ci-sample`` and check_benchmark_regression.py). A
few loaders keep an intrinsic, language-agnostic infrastructure bound that
``--limit`` cannot lift (e.g. ``hitz_basque_ipa`` pages the HF rows API and
stops at ``_HITZ_BASQUE_MAX_PARAGRAPHS`` rather than pulling the full
1.67M-row set) — these are documented in docs/benchmarks.md.

Where things live
-----------------

The module reads top to bottom as fetch -> load -> provenance -> score ->
render. Each section carries a ``# ─── name ───`` header:

``dataset loaders``
    One ``load_<name>(lang, limit) -> [GoldPair, ...]`` per gold source.
    Uniform signature on purpose: that is what lets :data:`DATASETS`
    register them all interchangeably. Each loader's docstring records
    where its IPA came from — that provenance is the reason to trust or
    distrust every number derived from it, so it belongs with the loader.
``DATASETS``
    The registry. Adding a gold set = write a loader + add one entry here
    + record its :data:`PROVENANCE` tier. Nothing else needs to change.
``provenance / reliability tiers``
    :data:`RELIABILITY_TIERS`, :data:`PROVENANCE`, and
    :func:`can_gate_promotion` — which golds are trustworthy enough to FAIL
    a build on, and which may only report drift. A gold that is another
    tool's output can never gate.
``metric``
    :func:`normalize` (the one comparison space every system is scored in),
    :func:`levenshtein`, :func:`align`, and the :func:`evaluate` family.
    ``compare_systems.py`` imports these so its numbers are directly
    comparable to the scoreboard's.
``build_scoreboard`` / ``write_scoreboard``
    Sweep every registered dataset/language, then render
    docs/scoreboard.md + benchmarks/results.json.
``lexicon-overlay report``
    The separate rules-only-vs-with-lexicon board (``--lexicon-report``);
    it writes its own docs page and never touches the main scoreboard.

#: Stress marks stripped from BOTH sides when ``strip_stress`` is set.
#: U+02C8/U+02CC are the IPA primary/secondary marks. The ASCII apostrophe is
#: not IPA at all, but several expert gold sets (4catac) use it as the stress
#: mark — leaving it in made every stressed syllable in the gold an unmatched
#: character, which cost Catalan ~7 PER points of pure notation. The IPA
#: modifier apostrophe U+02BC is deliberately NOT here: it marks ejectives and
#: is a real segment. The Scandinavian pitch-accent digits ¹/² are stripped
#: too, but ONLY for a language whose spec declares a pitch accent
#: (``StressRules.accent2_mark`` — see :func:`_prosody_marks`): there they
#: are word-prosodic, not segmental, and the one gold set that writes them
#: (wikipron Swedish) marks them inconsistently — attested accent-2 trochees
#: like ⟨alla⟩ ⟨anka⟩ are left bare — so scoring them measures the
#: annotators' coverage, not G2P quality. For any other language the digits
#: stay: Yi (ycl) gold writes lexical TONE with the same superscripts
#: (²¹, ³³), and those are segments a G2P must produce.
_STRESS_MARKS = "ˈˌ'"
#: Tie bars are notation, not phonology: t͡s and ts are the same phoneme
#: string at every transcription tier, so they are stripped from BOTH
#: sides unconditionally (unlike the narrow diacritics below, which only
#: strip under --broad).
_TIE_BARS = "͜͡‿"

_NARROW_MARKS = "̝̞̪̺̻̼̘̙̯.·()"

#: Click accompaniment notation: a click's release/manner accompaniment
#: (velar ⟨k⟩, nasal ⟨ŋ⟩) is conventionally written either as a full IPA
#: letter immediately before the click letter (kǀ, ŋǃ) OR with the same
#: accompaniment carried by a dedicated superscript modifier letter in the
#: same slot (ᵏǀ, ᵑǃ) -- both are attested, interchangeable transcription
#: conventions for the SAME segment sequence, not a phonemic contrast (IPA
#: Chart 2015, superscript-modifier-letter convention; Ladefoged &
#: Maddieson, *The Sounds of the World's Languages*, 1996, ch.8 "Clicks",
#: pp.246-260, describing accompaniments transcribed either way with no
#: distinction implied). Folded ONLY when the modifier letter sits directly
#: next to one of the five IPA click letters (_CLICK_LETTERS), COMBINING
#: MARKS ON THE MODIFIER (e.g. a combining ring below for voicelessness,
#: ᵑ̊) allowed to ride along: ᵏ/ᵑ anywhere else (e.g. the common Bantuist
#: prenasalized-stop notation ᵑg/ᵐb) is a different, unrelated convention
#: and must not be touched. ʘ/ǀ/ǁ/ǃ/ǂ are five distinct click TYPES
#: (different active articulators) and are never folded into each other.
#: Applied AFTER the final whitespace join (some gold sets space-separate
#: phonemes, putting the modifier and its click letter on opposite sides
#: of a space -- e.g. "ᵑ ǂ" -- which must still fold).
_CLICK_LETTERS = "ǀǁǃǂʘ"
_CLICK_ACCOMPANIMENT_SUPERSCRIPTS = {"ᵏ": "k", "ᵑ": "ŋ"}
#: U+1DF06 (𝼆, "LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED Y WITH BELT") is NOT a click
#: letter and is never folded into one. It is a ligature-style shorthand
#: for the voiceless palatal lateral fricative ʎ̥˔ (Unicode 13.0, 2021 --
#: analogous to how ɬ is a dedicated letter for the voiceless alveolar
#: lateral fricative). The Hadza wikipron alphabet-table rows write the
#: Hadza "tl" lateral affricate as bare 𝼆, while the corresponding word
#: rows write the SAME segment tie-barred as c͜ʎ̥˔ (see the "hts" registry
#: comment below) -- so the fold target is ʎ̥˔, not ǁ.
_NOTATIONAL_LETTER_ALIASES = {"𝼆": "ʎ̥˔"}

#: ASCII "g" (U+0067, keyboard Latin) vs the official IPA voiced velar
#: plosive ɡ (U+0261, LATIN SMALL LETTER SCRIPT G) — a Unicode confusable,
#: not a phonemic contrast (IPA Handbook, 1999, §"Consonants": the plosive
#: symbol is U+0261; ASCII "g" is a font-rendering/keyboard stand-in with
#: no distinct value anywhere in the Handbook's inventory). Several gold
#: sets (e.g. NorthEuraLex's CLDF Segments column) were keyed with the
#: plain ASCII letter, so a transcription that correctly emits ɡ was
#: being penalised for a typographic accident rather than an error. Folded
#: UNCONDITIONALLY (both strip_stress states, narrow and broad) because no
#: registered spec's own phoneme inventory contrasts "g" against "ɡ" —
#: verified against every data/*.json phonemes list before adding this.
#: Prosodic/orthographic punctuation carried by sentence-level gold sets
#: (phrase breaks, commas, full stops). None of it is a phoneme, so scoring it
#: as one penalises a transcription for text the engine correctly ignores.
_PUNCT_MARKS = "|‖,.;:!?¡¿\"«»—–-"

#: The reconstruction asterisk. A leading "*" on a transcription is the
#: historical-linguistics mark for a form that is not attested — one
#: inferred rather than recorded (Graffi 2002, "The asterisk from historical
#: to descriptive and theoretical linguistics", Historiographia Linguistica
#: 29(3):329-338, doi:10.1075/hl.29.3.04gra, on the asterisk's original and
#: still-standard historical-linguistic value 'unattested form'). It is a
#: status annotation on the transcription, never a segment, and no engine
#: can or should emit it, so counting it as one charges every such row an
#: insertion error that is unreachable by construction. Stripped
#: UNCONDITIONALLY, on the same footing as the "g"/"ɡ" fold above: no
#: registered spec's phoneme inventory contains "*" — verified across all
#: 7658 data/*.json inventories, and across every phoneme-valued field
#: (grapheme outputs, allophone surfaces, word exceptions) as well. The one
#: "*" that does appear as a spec KEY is ar-Latn-buckwalter's grapheme for
#: ⟨ذ⟩ ð, which is INPUT orthography and never passes through this function.
#:
#: What the mark annotates varies, and the fold flattens that difference —
#: which is the cost of stripping, stated here so it is not rediscovered.
#: In WikiPron's Tibetan scrape it is systematic: 1538 of 3621 rows are the
#: Old Tibetan reading en.wiktionary's Module:bo-pron infers from the
#: spelling, and the mark is a prefix on the whole reading. In the Old
#: French scrape it is narrower: all 4 rows belong to peluchier, an ATTESTED
#: headword whose wikitext
#: ({{IPA|fro|/pəlyˈt͡ʃjeːɾ/|/*pəlyˈk(j)eːɾ/|q2=northern|a=classical}} and
#: its late-period twin) marks only the second slot, a reconstructed
#: NORTHERN pronunciation offered beside attested classical and late ones.
#: So the mark can sit on a reconstructed pronunciation of a perfectly
#: attested word, and stripping lets that reconstruction compete for the
#: match as if it had been recorded.
#:
#: That is harmless today for the only reason that it happens to be true of
#: peluchier: the scorer takes the minimum over a headword's golds, and
#: peluchier also carries unstarred attested transcriptions, which win. That
#: is why fro does not move on the board. The condition under which this
#: decision must be revisited is therefore precise — a gold whose ONLY
#: transcription for some headword is a starred one. There the spec would be
#: scored against a reconstruction as though it were attested, and this fold
#: would hide the fact that it had been. Nothing registered here is in that
#: state; check for it before wiring a gold that carries the mark.

# candidates"): the o2i ``zh`` spec is a PINYIN spec, while
# ``zh-cn.tsv``'s ``aligned_sentence`` column is Han characters
# (``盘固 草 为 禾 本科 …``). Every single row therefore transcribes to the
# empty string, and the board carried a meaningless ``per: 1.0`` row for
# ``zh`` built entirely out of "hypothesis is empty, so the whole gold is a
# deletion". That is not a Mandarin score; it is the absence of a
# hanzi→pinyin front-end, measured in the units of a phone error rate. The
# registration comes back the day such a front-end exists.
#
# ``yue`` (Cantonese) is DELIBERATELY not registered here even though the
# upstream ``yue.tsv`` file exists and loads fine (12.8k rows, live-checked
# 2026-08). The `yue` spec is a genuine grapheme-inventory STUB (see
# orthography2ipa/g2p.py get('yue').notes): Cantonese is logographic and
# has no letter-to-sound mapping without a Jyutping/Yale romanisation step
# upstream of this library -- exactly like ``zh`` needs pinyin. The
# vox-communis ``yue.tsv`` ``sentence``/``aligned_sentence`` columns are raw
# Han characters, so every row transcribes to an empty hypothesis and the
# harness previously recorded a fake ``per: 1.0, n: 0`` row for it. That
# was dishonest (n=0 read as "loader is broken", not "this pairing can
# never score"); removing the registration until a Jyutping/Yale

# - ko-KR: WIRABLE NOW, pending verification — the ko spec reads Hangul
#   syllable blocks since the conjoining-jamo graphemes + canonical

    # `quy` happens to score a little lower on this gold; taking that score
    # would be fitting the row to the gold against the corpus's own evidence.
    #
    # The row keeps a high PER floor that is notation, not error. espeak-ng's
    # `qu` voice (dictsource/qu_rules) is a plain letter-to-phoneme table: it
    # writes /i u/ as lax [ɪ ʊ] (2391 substitutions), ⟨ch⟩ with a retraction
    # diacritic as t̠ʃ (735), the tap as a trill r (536), and an ejective as the
    # ejective plus a spurious glottal stop, ⟨k'⟩ → kʼʔ (133, from the rule file's
    # own "q' → q`?"). It applies no uvular lowering at all, so every [ɑ ɛ ɔ]
    # this spec derives by rule is scored as an error (538). Where the two
    # disagree on a segment the cited source settles it: ⟨sh⟩ is /ʃ/ in Cusco,

# Lexibank/CLDF wordlist gold. Lexibank (github.com/lexibank) republishes
# published comparative wordlists/dictionaries as CLDF (Cross-Linguistic Data
# Format): one ``cldf/forms.csv`` per dataset, keyed by ``Language_ID`` (the
# dataset's own language code, resolved via ``cldf/languages.csv``), with a
# ``Value`` column (the word as originally recorded — real orthography or
# script) and a ``Segments`` column (space-separated IPA-ish segments, with
# ``+`` marking a morpheme boundary). Every row cites its source dictionary
# in the ``Source`` column, so this is compiled/cited lexicographic data, not
# phonemizer output — ``lexicon-derived``, the same tier as ``cmudict`` and
# ``portuguese_unified``.
#
# Candidates inspected and NOT wired:
#
# - `lexibank/ids` (Intercontinental Dictionary Series): ``Segments`` is
#   EMPTY on every one of its 437k rows (verified by scanning the whole
#   file) — there is no IPA column to score against at all.
# - `lexibank/abvd` (Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database): same problem,
#   ``Segments`` empty on all 346k rows.
#
# 2026-08 audit wave — 21 more candidates inspected, NONE wired. Full verdicts
# and evidence in docs/benchmark_datasets.md "Rejected candidates". Summary:
#
# - `uralex`: ``Segments`` empty on all sampled rows (same as ids/abvd).
# - `tuled`, `dravlex`, `chaconarawakan`, `felekesemitic`, `hantganbangime`,
#   `lundgrenomagoa`, `naganorgyalrongic`, `sagartst`, `savelyevturkic`,
#   `abrahammonpa`, `allenbai`, `bantubvd`, `chindialectsurvey`,
#   `birchallchapacuran`, `gravinachadic`, `kraftchadic`,
#   `luangthongkumkaren`, `marrisonnaga`, `mitterhoferbena`: ``Value`` is
#   itself an IPA/comparative-transcription string (tone marks, IPA-only
#   symbols, sense-index suffixes, or a fieldworker's normalized transcription
#   convention applied uniformly across many languages) — not each
#   language's own writing system, failing the "Form must be real
#   orthography, not transcription" rule this loader exists to enforce.
# - `robinsonap`: the one candidate whose ``Value`` genuinely reads as
#   practical orthography (real digraphs, e.g. ``ng``→``ŋ``). Still not
#   wired: all 13 languages resolve to `stub`-quality o2i specs with an
#   EMPTY grapheme table, so there is nothing for a gold row to exercise yet.
#

    says that "certain letters with diacritics (ë ā ē ī ō ū ȥ) are not

    Ewe, Yoruba and Hebrew titles likewise drop tone marks and niqqud.
    The orthography those rows hand the engine therefore does not encode

    a page with no headword override, no section for the language, or

    comparable to that row restricted to the same words. Nothing is

    Middle High German is scored against ``gmh``, never against
    ``gmh-x-wikt``: ``gmh-x-wikt`` models the title-form spelling the

    """VoxCommunis parallel G2P pairs (fdemelo/vox-communis-parallel-g2p on
    Hugging Face, CC0): Common Voice utterances force-aligned by the
    VoxCommunis Corpus, with per-utterance phone strings whose lexicons came
    from Epitran, the XPF Corpus, Charsiu and custom dictionaries (manually
    corrected in part). One small TSV per language (~hundreds of rows).

    The ``phonemized_sentence`` column is space-separated phones with ``|``
    between words, aligned with the whitespace-tokenized
    ``aligned_sentence``; rows are split into word-level (word, IPA) pairs
    the same way ``load_ipa_childes`` does, skipping rows whose token counts
    do not match. Alignment artifacts (underscores, stray apostrophes) are
    stripped from the phone side.

    ``spn`` TOKENS ARE DROPPED. ``spn`` is the Montreal Forced Aligner's
    "spoken noise" symbol, which the VoxCommunis pipeline also emits for any
    word its lexicon could not cover: the phone tier records the literal
    three-character string ``spn`` in place of that word's phones. It is a
    coverage hole marker, not a transcription. Scoring it as gold is not
    merely noisy, it is unbounded: PER is normalised by the GOLD length, so
    a real 10-segment word scored against the 3-character ``spn`` yields a
    per-word PER above 3. Whole languages were driven past PER 1.0 by this
    alone (``ab`` 46.5% of tokens ``spn``, ``kk`` 59.4%, ``cv`` 31.3%,
    ``ba`` 15.1%, ``it`` 12.5%, ``sr`` 9.6% — measured over the cached
    TSVs, 2026-08). Dropping the token is the only honest reading: the
    dataset is telling us it has no gold for that word.

    ``spn`` is the ONLY token filtered. The obvious siblings do occur in
    these files, but as genuine transcriptions of real words — Welsh
    ``sul`` → /sil/ (336 rows), Amharic ``ሲል``, Bulgarian ``сп``, Tamil
    ``ஸ்ப்``, Korean ``실``, Punjabi ``ਸੀਲ`` — so filtering on the phone
    string would delete real gold. See ``_VOX_COMMUNIS_NON_SPEECH`` for
    the 61 identity rows (word and phones both ``sil``/``sp``) that are
    also left alone, and why.

    PROVENANCE — classified ``epitran-derived`` (the competitor tier): the
    phone tier's lexicons are built with Epitran — a scored competitor in
    docs/comparison.md — alongside XPF/Charsiu, so a disagreement here
    measures divergence from a competitor's output. Directional signal
    only; can never gate a regression or a tier promotion.

    ``ab`` IS WEAKER STILL, and the tier cannot say so. Epitran ships no
    Abkhaz map at all (epitran 1.35.2 ``epitran/data/map/``: 161 maps, 14
    Cyrillic, nearest Northwest Caucasian ``kbd-Cyrl`` for Kabardian), so
    the "epitran" in this row's label is not literally true — the ab phone
    tier came from XPF, Charsiu or a custom lexicon, unattributed. More
    importantly the gold cannot express the contrast Abkhaz is built on.
    Measured over the cached TSV: 44,279 of 76,464 word types (57.9%) are
    ``spn`` rather than a transcription, and eight letters are at 100%
    ``spn`` — ⟨ә⟩ (30,743 types), ⟨ԥ⟩ (7,984), ⟨қ⟩ (7,058), ⟨ӡ⟩ (5,024),
    ⟨ҩ⟩ (4,035), ⟨ҿ⟩ (2,678), ⟨ӷ⟩ (1,741), ⟨џ⟩ (811). ⟨ә⟩ U+04D9 is the
    orthography's LABIALISATION modifier letter, so every labialised
    spelling is a coverage hole, and the 32,185 scoreable types draw on 35
    distinct phone symbols with no /ʷ/ among them — in a language that
    contrasts ~58 consonants against two vowels largely by labialisation
    and palatalisation (Beguš 2021,
    doi:10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190690694.013.18, §2.2.1).

    No ``PROVENANCE_BY_LANG`` override is applied, deliberately. The tier
    lattice has no rung BELOW a competitor's output: ``machine-generated``
    reads as the weakest tier in docs/benchmarks.md but is a QUALIFYING one
    (``can_gate_promotion`` is True for it and False for
    ``epitran-derived``), so overriding ``ab`` down to it would hand a
    gating vote to the least trustworthy row on the board. Leaving the
    dataset-wide tier in place keeps the row non-qualifying, which is the
    outcome the measurements argue for; the inaccurate half of the label is
    corrected here in prose instead.

    THE ``pt`` FILE IS EUROPEAN PORTUGUESE, and it is mapped to ``pt-BR``
    because Common Voice's Portuguese traffic is predominantly Brazilian.
    The phone tier is not: measured over the cached TSV, final ⟨-l⟩
    vocalises to [w] in 0 of 948 words, ⟨t⟩ affricates before /i/ in 0 of
    2,378, ⟨d⟩ in 5 of 1,637, final unstressed ⟨-e⟩ raises to [i] in 0 of
    2,956 and ⟨-o⟩ to [u] in 0 of 7,429, while the European coda sibilant
    [ʃ] appears on all 7,429 words ending in ⟨-s⟩. Its 34-symbol inventory
    also has neither ⟨ʎ⟩ nor ⟨ɲ⟩, so the ⟨lh⟩ and ⟨nh⟩ digraphs lose their
    ⟨h⟩ across 513 and 717 words (gatilho → ``ɡɐtilo``), and it applies the
    European coda-sibilant rule inside the ⟨ss⟩ digraph on 981 of 995 ⟨ss⟩
    words (isso → ``iʃso``). ``scripts/fold_pt_br_notation.py`` folds these
    conventions out one at a time and lands at 0.2534 from 0.3886. Read the
    row as a measurement of Epitran's European map; see
    docs/languages/pt-BR.md.

    The Vietnamese file shows what that tier is protecting against, and is
    worked out in full in docs/languages/vi.md. Its PER of 0.5596 is almost
    entirely transcription convention — ``scripts/fold_vi_notation.py``
    folds the conventions out of both sides one at a time and lands at
    0.0246 — and its tone tier writes one letter, [˨˨], for both ngang and
    huyền, which are contrastive (Kirby 2011: 386, ma 'ghost' / mà 'but'),
    on 967 of the row's 2,475 words. Read that row as notation drift, never
    as evidence about the Vietnamese spec. The tier is deliberately left at
    the dataset-wide ``epitran-derived``: it already returns False from
    :func:`can_gate_promotion`, whereas ``machine-generated`` does NOT.
    Gating power follows position in :data:`RELIABILITY_TIERS` — everything
    after :data:`GATING_CUTOFF_TIER` is non-qualifying — and
    ``machine-generated`` sits EARLIER in that tuple than ``epitran-derived``,
    so relabelling the row that way moves it UP the lattice and would hand it
    a gating vote it must not have.

    group), ~1.67M ``text``/``phonemes`` rows at PARAGRAPH level.

    This is a COMPLEMENTARY source to the existing ``wikipron`` "eu" entry,
    not a replacement: wikipron/eu is Wiktionary-sourced broad
    transcriptions, this is a much larger corpus phonemized by an

    is published by an academic/university NLP research center (HiTZ) --
    see docs/benchmarks.md for the full rationale; this is not a general
    exception to the "gold only from humans" rule.

    The dataset is paragraph-level, a different shape than this harness's
    word-level gold sets. Rows are paged through the Hugging Face
    datasets-server "rows" REST API (no full-parquet download, no
    ``datasets`` dependency needed); each paragraph's ``text`` and
    ``phonemes`` are whitespace-tokenized (ahoNT emits one phoneme token
    per source word with punctuation attached to the token, per the
    dataset card), tokens are paired positionally, and surrounding
    punctuation is stripped from both sides to yield single-word (word,
    IPA) pairs. The dataset's own apostrophe stress convention
    (``'a``/``'e``/... before the stressed vowel, per the dataset card)
    is normalized to the standard IPA stress mark (U+02C8) so the
    harness's default stress-stripping applies consistently across
    datasets. Following ``load_ep_dialects``'s precedent of scoring
    non-single-word/paragraph-derived gold spans through the same
    ``transcribe_word``/PER pipeline, single word-tokens (rather than
    whole sentences) are used as the scored unit here, since paragraph-
    level ahoNT stress placement is not verified to need sentence context,
    making the single-token span the safer/cleaner unit to isolate.

    This loader pages the datasets-server API and stops at
    ``_HITZ_BASQUE_MAX_PARAGRAPHS`` paragraphs -- an intrinsic bound that
    ``limit=None`` does NOT lift, so this is the one dataset the full-dataset
    scoreboard does not read end-to-end (never the full 1.67M-row set). The
    bound is disclosed in ``docs/benchmarks.md``.

    PRODUCTION METHOD — this gold is MORPHOPHONEMIC / accentuator-driven,
    not a surface-phonetic transcription: it is grapheme-faithful (no
    vowel reduction — unstressed vowels keep their full quality, e.g.
    молчал → m_o0_l_ch_a1_l with an unreduced [o], never akanje [ɐ]/[ə]) and

    (298/300 его-suffix rows checked carry [g], confirming this is a fixed
    orthography-driven rule of the annotation pipeline, not a transcription
    error). o2i's Russian output is surface-phonetic (it reduces unstressed
    vowels and realizes genitive ⟨г⟩ as [v]), so PER against this gold will
    show systematic, EXPECTED disagreement on exactly those two phenomena —
    that is a notation mismatch between two legitimate conventions, not a
    model error, and it must not be "fixed" by adding akanje/г-devoicing
    exceptions to o2i to chase this one gold's convention.

    PROVENANCE — classified ``machine-generated``: the phone tier is an
    automatic accentuator/G2P annotation over its5Q/biggest-ru-book, not a
    hand-transcribed or lexicon-derived gold. Directional signal only; see

    The published dictionaries (``slovari.rar``, fetched once into

    realization, over three sub-corpora: ``READ`` (read speech), ``MONO``

    contributes SEVERAL rows, and all of them are kept — the harness scores
    a hypothesis against the best of a word's references, so the corpus's
    pronunciation variation is used as multi-reference gold rather than
    being collapsed to an arbitrary winner.

    Rows are rejected, never patched, when the orthographic side is a
    cross-word coalescence (``если_они``, ``потому=что``: the conventions
    page defines these composite wordforms, and their transcriptions carry
    sandhi a word-level G2P cannot produce), a truncated fragment
    (``Инфо+рм-``), an unreadable legacy encoding (a handful of very
    high-variance filler words), or when the transcription contains a
    symbol the conventions page does not define.

    PRODUCTION METHOD — HUMAN-ANNOTATED and SURFACE-PHONETIC. The lab
    transcribed the acoustic signal directly, explicitly suppressing the
    transcriber's lexical and grammatical knowledge, so a row records what
    a speaker actually said in unscripted conversation, not what a
    dictionary says the word is. Colloquial speech reduces far harder than
    the careful speech behind a pronunciation lexicon: whole syllables
    disappear (⟨Александровна⟩ [l'iksan@], ⟨Волгоград⟩ [vodgrat]), and no
    G2P can or should predict that. PER against this gold is therefore a
    FLOOR on Russian error, and a much higher one than against a
    careful-speech reference — it must be read as the distance to
    spontaneous-speech surface forms, and compared only against other runs
    on this same dataset, never against a lexicon gold's number. Nothing
    here licenses adding reduction rules to o2i to close that gap: the
    variation is speaker- and context-specific, and fitting it would be
    gold-fitting.

# ─── provenance / reliability tiers ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Reliable G2P "gold" barely exists. Almost every dataset wired here is
# semi-automated, dictionary-extracted, community-scraped, or a
# phonemizer's OWN output reused as a reference. A low PER against a
# machine-generated gold means "agrees with that tool", NOT "correct".
# Treat every scoreboard number as directional, never precise. The
# reliability tier below is surfaced per-row in docs/scoreboard.md and
# benchmarks/results.json so the caveat travels WITH the numbers.
#
# Tiers, most to least trustworthy (all still subject to notation
# conventions and small-n noise — see docs/benchmarks.md "Provenance and
# reliability"):
#
#   expert-human     — IPA curated by phoneticians, trained annotators, or
#                      native speakers. Still bound by the transcription
#                      conventions of the annotating team and, here, often
#                      small-n and/or not externally peer-validated.
#   lexicon-derived  — human lexicographers, but via a published
#                      dictionary's notation conventions and sometimes a
#                      mechanical notation transform (ARPABET→IPA,
#                      slashed-phonemic→IPA).
#   crowd-scraped    — Wiktionary community edits; uneven per language, and
#                      some entries are themselves editor-applied rule output
#                      rather than attested transcriptions.
#   machine-generated— some other tool's output used as the reference (a
#                      transliteration table, a research phonemizer we do not
#                      compete with). Scoring against it measures AGREEMENT
#                      WITH THAT TOOL, not correctness.
#
# A GOLD SET'S VALUE IS ITS ERROR MODEL. The three tiers below are ordered by
# how much a disagreement tells you:
#
#   espeak-derived   — the gold is espeak-ng's own output (directly, or via
#   epitran-derived    phonemizer/G2P+ which wrap it), or epitran's. Both are
#                      COMPETITORS we benchmark ourselves against
#                      (docs/comparison.md has espeak_per and epitran_per
#                      columns), so the row measures AGREEMENT WITH A
#                      COMPETITOR. It is still diagnostic — they are
#                      deterministic rule systems, so a disagreement can be
#                      traced to a rule and adjudicated against a cited source,
#                      and diverging from them may be exactly right. But it can
#                      never CERTIFY us: it can neither qualify a language for
#                      promotion nor block one (docs/quality_tiers.md).
#   llm-generated    — the gold was produced by a large language model. Worst
#                      of all: no lexicon, no G2P model, no rules — therefore
#                      NO ERROR MODEL. The output is plausible-looking IPA that
#                      can be confidently wrong with no systematic structure, so
#                      a disagreement is not even diagnostic: you cannot
#                      attribute it to anything. Certifies nothing, diagnoses
#                      nothing. Directional curiosity only; never gate on it.

# Gold produced by a G2P system we ourselves benchmark AGAINST. The specific
# tool is recorded in the tier name (rather than one flat "competitor-derived"
# label) because the identity of the competitor is what a reader needs in order
# to interpret the row: an espeak-derived row on English and an epitran-derived
# row on Spanish are non-comparable evidence, and the circularity warning for
# each points at a different column of docs/comparison.md.

# The last tier in RELIABILITY_TIERS that may gate a quality decision. Gating
# power is DERIVED from tuple position rather than listed separately, so the
# order above is the contract: a tier earlier in the tuple can never have less
# gating power than a later one, and moving a row's tier up the tuple is always
# an upgrade. The two are stated once because stating them twice is how they
# drift — and a reader who mistook the tuple for a ladder that the gating sets
# did not follow would reach exactly the wrong conclusion about which way a
# reclassification moves a row.
#
# The cutoff sits AFTER `machine-generated`, which therefore gates. That is
# deliberate and it is the one place where this lattice and the narrower
# `_GOLD_TIERS` in scripts/compare_systems.py disagree, so it is worth being
# explicit about why. The two answer different questions. compare_systems asks
# whether a row may support a "we beat espeak" claim, and there an automatic
# phonemizer's output is agreement rather than accuracy, so it does not
# qualify. This lattice asks whether a PER movement on a row may block a merge
# or qualify a language, and there the relevant property is whether the
# reference has an error model a disagreement can be attributed to. A
# phonemizer's output does: it is a rule or model system whose divergences can
# be traced and adjudicated, exactly as espeak's can. What disqualifies the
# competitor tiers is not that they are machine-made but that they are the
# specific systems this project scores itself against, which makes a
# disagreement with them a measure of our distance from a benchmark rival.

    ``limit`` is the per-dataset row cap. Pass ``None`` (the default for
    the committed ``--scoreboard`` run) to score the ENTIRE gold set of
    every language with no truncation — the published scoreboard is
    full-dataset. A concrete integer is only for ad-hoc fast runs and for
    the CI regression sample (see ``check_benchmark_regression.py``); it
    is applied UNIFORMLY to every language (no per-language cap juggling).
    ``None`` is passed to the loaders as ``sys.maxsize`` so their
    ``len(pairs) >= limit`` / ``pairs[:limit]`` guards become no-ops.

    ``oracle`` adds the top-k oracle PER columns (see
    :class:`OracleResult` for what they mean and what they must NOT be
    used for). It defaults to **OFF**, and every caller that wants it
    says so. The published ``--scoreboard`` run opts in; the CI
    regression gate (``check_benchmark_regression.py``) and the
    ``--ci-sample`` baseline do not, because they compare 1-best PER
    only and would otherwise pay ~1.6x for columns they never read.
    Defaulting to off is what keeps a future call site from silently
    inheriting that cost.

    ``expose_ambiguous_endings`` is the measurement convention, and the
    published board uses the default **False** (see
    :func:`evaluate_words_oracle`). It is threaded through rather than
    hardcoded so the row's ``oracle_injected_alternatives`` field can be
    derived from the flag the row was SCORED with — a provenance field
    that asserts an exclusion the run did not perform is worse than none.

    ``only_langs`` / ``only_datasets`` restrict the run to a subset. The
    full scoreboard is ~10M scored words and takes hours, so a targeted
    rerun is the practical way to refresh a handful of rows; the caller
    then MERGES the result into the committed set (see
    :func:`merge_scoreboard_rows`). A subset run scores each row exactly
    as the full run does — no row depends on which others ran with it.

# ─── lexicon-overlay report (E3) ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The lexicon overlay (orthography2ipa/lexicon.py) is only honest if we can see
# how much of a language's accuracy comes from the *rules* versus the shipped
# sidecar TSV. This report re-scores the same gold twice — once with the
# lexicon disabled ("rules-only PER") and once with it on ("with-lexicon PER")
# — for every language with a registered lexicon (none are bundled), so a regression
# in rule quality can't hide behind lexicon coverage. It is a SEPARATE artifact
# from the main scoreboard (docs/scoreboard.md is left untouched): languages
# with no lexicon are byte-identical with or without this feature.

# wikipron gold tags to score per lexicon code (a lexicon file is named by the
# resolved spec code; several BCP-47 tags can resolve to it and have their own
# gold — e.g. both "en" (US) and "en-GB" (UK) resolve to the en-GB spec).
