"""No Arabic variety in the registry resolves to an empty table.

A spec that declares a parent and no ``graphemes_base`` produces nothing: the code
resolves, returns a Spec, and that Spec has no phonology. A caller gets an empty answer
rather than an error, which is the silent form of not being covered.

These twelve Arabic varieties were in that state. They now inherit their parent's table,
which makes them usable and is NOT a claim about the variety -- ``quality`` stays ``stub``
and each note says the table is the parent's. The tests hold both halves: the code must
reach a table, and the spec must not start asserting reflexes nobody cited.
