"""Quantity-sensitive stress: placement by syllable weight, not by spelling.

The end-anchored systems (Portuguese, Spanish, Italian) pick the stressed
syllable from an orthographic ending. Arabic and Latin do not: stress falls on a
syllable because that syllable is **heavy**, and weight is a property of the
transcription — a long vowel, a coda — not of the spelling. No ending table can
express it, which is exactly why the Arabic spec used to declare no stress at
all.
