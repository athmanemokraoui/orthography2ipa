"""Tests for competitor-derived and LLM-generated gold.

A gold set's value is its ERROR MODEL:

- human / lexicon gold is trustworthy;
- rule-system gold (espeak, epitran) measures agreement with a system this
  project benchmarks itself AGAINST (docs/comparison.md scores both
  ``espeak_per`` and ``epitran_per``), so it is diagnostic — a deterministic
  rule system's disagreements can be traced to a rule and adjudicated — but it
  can never CERTIFY us;
- LLM gold has no lexicon, no rules and therefore no error model at all: a
  disagreement is not even attributable, so it certifies nothing and diagnoses
  nothing.

These tests are the forcing function for that distinction: the tiers exist, the
IPA-CHILDES rows carry the tier of the TOOL its dataset card names for that
language (not one flattering dataset-wide tier), and no such row can qualify a
language for the ``production`` quality tier (docs/quality_tiers.md).
